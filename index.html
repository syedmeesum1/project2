            <td><div></div><h1>Babar Azam</h1>When Babar Azam notched up his 5th ODI ton against West Indies in his 25th innings in early 2017, he became the second quickest after Quinton De Kock to score five ODI tons. His aggregate of 1306 runs after 25 knocks tallied the highest, beating Jonathan Trott's numbers. Life indeed has been on fast tracks for Babar Azam. His three consecutive ODI tons against the Windies in 2016 in the UAE were a precursor to one glorious career that stares at us.
            </div></td>
            <td><div><h1>Shaheen fridi</h1>There is no denying the fact that Shaheen Afridi's potential is scaringly infinite. Blessed with a tall gangling frame and the ability to bowl really fast, Afridi also like his famous namesake can strike the ball really hard with the bat in hand. Add to all this his variety as a left-arm bowler and you know why there is immense excitement around this man in Pakistan. Born in a family of seven.</div></td>
            <td><div><h1>Hassan Ali</h1>A modern day fast bowler hailing from Punjab, who relies on variations rather than on raw pace, a breed rarely seen from Pakistan. A silky smooth action which helps him in his economical approach to the crease, Ali has graduated through age group cricket and his moment of fame came in Pakistan's limited over's leg in England 2016 where he played four ODIs and the only T20I after making his ODI debut against Ireland on the same tour.</div></td>

Like many aspiring players from his country, he wanted to emulate Wasim Akram but he didn't have the pace his coaches were looking for. Still, the switch to left-arm spin has worked for him. A capable middle-order batsman as well, he was part of the Pakistan side that won the Youth World Cup in 2006, before captaining them in the next edition.t wasn't until 2015, when the senior team were searching for a replacement for the suspended Saeed Ajmal,

            <td><div><h1>Naseem Shah</h1>Zarai Taraqiati Bank Limited may not be an esteemed name in Pakistan cricket, but it was for this deparment that Naseem Shah made his first-class debut at 15. With a natural, whippy action that generated easy pace, he immediately stood out even in that most competitive of fields - Pakistani fast bowling. A year later, he was making his Pakistan debut in Brisbane, though not before adversity touched him; he would lose his mother just before he received his first Pakistan cap.</div></td>
            <td><div><h1>Amir Jamal</h1>A solid all-rounder, who has the ability to bowl quick, has good variations and also a tough mentality, Aamer Jamal made his international debut against England in September 2022. His T20I debut wasn't memorable one, but he shone in his debut Test series against Australia down under. On his debut Test, Jamal bagged a six-wicket haul at Perth and followed it up with another impressive performance in the same series. At the SCG, Jamal claimed another six-wicket haul and ended up picking up 18 wickets in 3 Tests. In the same Test at Sydney, Jamal also showcased his talent as a batter as the all-rounder smashed 82 runs against a fiery Australian bowling attack. </div></td>
